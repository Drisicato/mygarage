"""The standard coverage catalogue, and the parser that maps text onto it.

A declarations page prints the same four things for every coverage it lists:
the limits, the deductible and the premium. `COVERAGES` below is that table,
in the order it is shown to the user, and `insurance_coverages` rows carry one
entry each.

WHY A CATALOGUE AND NOT COLUMNS. Every coverage would otherwise want its own
pair of columns ("each person", "each accident", "each day", "maximum days"),
and adding one would be a schema change. Instead the row has two generic limit
slots and this module says, per coverage, what they mean and whether they hold
money or a count. The table never moves when a coverage is added here.

A ROW'S EXISTENCE means the coverage is on the policy; its amounts say how
much. So a `roadside_assistance` row with four NULLs is not an empty row, it
is "included", and deleting it is how a user says the coverage is not carried.

THE PARSER (`parse_coverage_lines`) has two callers that must never disagree:
migration 108, converting the free text this catalogue replaced, and the PDF
route, converting a declarations page. Keeping it here, beside the phrases it
matches on, is what keeps them the same parser.
