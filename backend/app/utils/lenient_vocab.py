"""Reading a stored vocabulary value the vocabulary doesn't know.

A response describes what's stored. A vocabulary column with no CHECK can hold
whatever a restored backup, a hand edit or a downgrade put there, and a strict
`Literal` on the response turns that one row into a 500 on every page that
lists it. So a lenient field reads an unknown value as null (or as the
vocabulary's own "unknown" member) and logs it once. The inputs stay strict.

A lenient field is a static alias, written where its vocabulary lives::

    LenientVehicleType = Annotated[
        VehicleType | None, BeforeValidator(lenient_reader(VehicleType)), LenientVocab(None)
    ]

The `LenientVocab` marker is how the response contract test tells a lenient
field from a strict one. That test also reads each marked field back, so a
marker can't promise more than its validator does.
