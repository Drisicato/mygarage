"""A full restore is staged while MyGarage runs and swapped in at the next start.

The running app's database can't be swapped out under it: the scheduler, the MQTT subscriber,
the Telegram poller and the request hold pooled connections, and one that still has the old WAL
open can write, or checkpoint old pages, into the new file. So the restore only stages, and the
lifespan swaps it in before anything opens the database. That relies on MyGarage being one
process (Dockerfile: --workers 1, which APScheduler needs too): the lock below keeps restore
operations apart, not another process's database connections.

The layout is a contract between the process that stages and the one that applies, which is a
newer version if the image was updated before the restart:

    <data_dir>/.restore-pending/manifest.json      written last: no manifest, no restore
    <data_dir>/.restore-pending/applying           down from before the first live change until
                                                   after the last: the live data may be half swapped
    <data_dir>/.restore-pending/<folder>           photos, documents, attachments
    <data_dir>/.restore-pending/previous/<folder>  a live folder, set aside mid-swap
    <database file, resolved>.restore-pending      the staged database, one self-contained file
    <data_dir>/.restore-pending.lock               never deleted

Every change is on disk before the next step relies on it. A file's fsync doesn't persist its
name, so the folder holding the name is fsynced too.
