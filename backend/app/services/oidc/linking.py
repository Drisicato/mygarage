"""OIDC account linking with password verification.

Functions for creating pending link tokens and validating them with password
verification to securely link OIDC accounts to existing local accounts
when the email or username claim matches an account that has a password.
Apart from a relink an admin armed on the account (see users.py), this is the
only way an email or username match ever links.
