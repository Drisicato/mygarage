"""One bound for every stored amount, whatever the viewer's currency.

Records carry no currency: an amount is a bare number shown in each viewer's
`currency_code`. So a money bound can only mean "fits the column" and "is a
number a household could mean", and the same bound serves forint and dollars.

Every money column is Numeric(12,2), every unit price Numeric(12,3), and the
supply unit-cost snapshot Numeric(15,4). Each max below is the largest value its
column holds, and each fits a double at its scale, so it round-trips through
SQLite's REAL and a JS number.

Use the aliases on input schemas only. A response carries no bounds, or a stored
value past today's bound turns every read of it into a 500.

    cost: OptionalMoney = None
    amount: Money = Field(..., decimal_places=2, description="Payment amount")

Pydantic merges an assigned `Field(...)` with the alias's, so a description or
`decimal_places` goes there.
