"""A vehicle's current odometer is the highest reading on its latest day.

An odometer does not run backwards within a day, so which source happened to
write its row first says nothing about which figure is current. The reads that
took the NEWEST row of the latest day reported a service visit's 50,000 km as
current when the tire it fitted had been mounted at 50,012 km earlier the same
day, and the new tire's distance then read as the odometer running backwards.

Every read of a current or latest odometer orders by date, then odometer, then
id. These tests seed the one shape that tells the two rules apart: on the
latest day, the higher reading has the OLDER id.
