"""The sticker review PATCH clears, keeps, and saves every field it shows.

It skipped every null, so a value cleared in the review came back. Six fields
the review edits (engine and transmission descriptions, wheel and tire specs,
the two environmental ratings) weren't on the schema at all and were dropped
without a word, and `sticker_drivetrain` was written by the upload but never
returned or editable.
