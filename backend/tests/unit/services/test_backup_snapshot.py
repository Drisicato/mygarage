"""Backup snapshot consistency tests (audit finding F2).

``create_full_backup`` must produce a SELF-CONTAINED ``mygarage.db``
member: every committed transaction present in that single file, with no
dependency on ``-wal``/``-shm`` sidecars. A raw file copy of a live
WAL-mode database fails this - committed rows that still live only in
the WAL are missing from the copied main file, and copying db/wal/shm
sequentially while a writer runs risks a torn, unrestorable archive.

The restore side has a matching hazard: restoring a self-contained db
member while stale live ``-wal``/``-shm`` files remain next to the
target would let SQLite replay the OLD wal over the NEW database.
