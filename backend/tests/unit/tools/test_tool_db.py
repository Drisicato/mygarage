"""`--db` must accept whatever database the instance actually runs.

The three raw-SQL maintenance tools took `--db` as a filesystem path and built
`sqlite:///{path}` from it unconditionally. That is wrong two ways on a
PostgreSQL instance: there is no path to give, and any path given produces an
empty SQLite file rather than an error.

`resolve_sync_url` keeps the old path form working, because the published
upgrade note tells people to pass `/data/mygarage.db`, and adds the two forms
that instance needs: a full URL, or nothing at all (fall back to the app's own
configured database).
