/**
 * One cache of `Intl.NumberFormat` instances, shared by every module that
 * formats a number.
 *
 * Constructing a formatter resolves the locale's number data and is the
 * expensive half of formatting; calling `.format` on it is the cheap half. The
 * formatting entry points here run once per rendered quantity, so before this
 * existed a vehicle list or a pack preview built and discarded a formatter per
 * number on screen.
 *
 * ★ IT IMPORTS NOTHING, AND THAT IS THE POINT. This started as a private helper
 * inside `unitFormat.ts`, which cannot be shared: `unitFormat` imports
 * `unitAdapters`, which imports `units`, so `units.ts` reaching back for it
 * would close a cycle. A leaf module with no imports can be depended on by all
 * of them.
 *
 * ★ THE KEY MUST NAME EVERYTHING THE OUTPUT DEPENDS ON, and the locale is the
 * one that is easy to forget. `getActiveLocale()` changes when the reader picks
 * a language, so a key without it would answer the first language's formatter
 * forever and separators would silently stop following the setting.
 * `localeFormatting.test.ts` is the guard for that.
 *
 * Callers pass the key rather than having it derived from the options, so no
 * serialization runs on the hot path. Write the key on the line above the
 * options it stands for, so the two cannot drift apart unseen, and never key on
 * something the options do not use or two callers will fight over one entry.
 *
 * ★ WHEN THE RESULT IS SMALL, CACHE THE RESULT INSTEAD. Two callers correctly do
 * not use this: `currency.getCurrencySymbol` caches the resolved symbol string,
 * and `decimalInput.localeDecimalSeparator` caches the one separator character.
 * Both build a formatter only to read a fragment out of it, so caching the
 * fragment is strictly cheaper than caching the machine that produced it.
