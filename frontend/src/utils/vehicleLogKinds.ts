/**
 * Which records a vehicle can log, from its type, fuel and usage settings.

 * ★ ONE RULE, TWO SURFACES. The vehicle page's tabs and Quick Entry's buttons
 * both read this. Quick Entry used to keep its own list, which offered every
 * vehicle Fuel Up and Mileage: a fifth wheel got the engine fuel form, never
 * its propane, and an odometer it does not have.
 *
 * Pure: structural input, so a full vehicle and Quick Entry's slim row both
 * pass.
